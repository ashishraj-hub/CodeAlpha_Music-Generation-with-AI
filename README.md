# 🎵 Music Generation with AI

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence** can be applied to generate music using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models. By training on MIDI files, the model learns musical patterns and produces new compositions that resemble the training data.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of MIDI files into numerical sequences.
- Training an LSTM-based neural network for sequence prediction.
- Generation of new music in MIDI format.
- Easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook for experimentation.
- Example output file: `ai_music.mid`.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Music21** (for MIDI processing)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (data handling)
- **Pickle** (saving preprocessed notes)

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashishraj-hub/CodeAlpha_Music-Generation-with-AI.git
   cd CodeAlpha_Music-Generation-with-AI

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## ▶️ Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook "Music Generation.ipynb"
  ```

2. Run all cells to:
 - Preprocess MIDI files.
 - Train the LSTM model.
 - Generate new music.

3. Find the generated music in:
  ```bash
  ai_music.mid.
  ```

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing

- Convert MIDI files into note sequences.
- Store sequences in notes.pkl.

2. Model Training

- Build an LSTM-based neural network.
- Train on note sequences to learn musical patterns.

3. Music Generation

- Predict next notes iteratively.
- Save output as a new MIDI file.

---

## 🎶 Example Output
Generated file:  
```bash
  ai_music.mid.
```
- You can play it using any MIDI player or DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).
